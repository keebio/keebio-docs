# Soldering Tools

So you want to build a keyboard, but are unsure of exactly what you'll need? Don't worry, here's a list of suggested tools for soldering:

## The Essentials

At the minimum, you'll need these items to build the keyboards that Keebio offers:

- Soldering Iron
- Solder
- Flush Cutters

### Soldering Iron

A temperature-controlled soldering iron is recommended. Even though you can get by with using a non-temperature-controlled one, for a beginner, it's very easy to burn pads on a PCB due to inconsistent temperatures and the iron getting too hot. A decent temperature-controlled soldering iron is not much more expensive than a regular one.

Here's a list of some suggested ones:

- [Aoyue 469 60W Soldering Station ($)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MCVCHJM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00MCVCHJM&linkCode=as2&tag=keebio-20&linkId=fc47f439d4e40d4c004a0ab02e98dc92) - Decent budget option
- [Aoyue 937+ Pro Series 45W Digitial Soldering Station ($$)](https://amzn.to/2yRIjNX) - Having a digital readout is very nice to have so you know what temperature the iron is at
- [Hakko FX888D ($$$)](https://amzn.to/2Kwb47s) - You'll see a lot of recommendations out there for this iron, and rightly so, as this is a quality soldering iron
- [TS100 Pocket-size Soldering Iron ($$)](https://amzn.to/2tYnM5m) - Nice little soldering iron with a digitial readout of the temperature

### Solder

Avoid lead-free solder unless you are more experienced. Lead-free solder requires high temperatures, and for someone starting out with soldering, using it often leads to cold joints and/or overheating of pads. Leaded solder is fine, and that's what most people use anyway.

Diameter: 0.031" solder is good for general usage. For SMD components which are smaller, 0.020" is recommended.

Tin/Lead Ratio: 63/37 or 60/40 are good ratios to go with. 63/37 stands for 63% tin, 37% lead.

- [Kester 24-6337-0027 Solder Roll, Core Size 66, 63/37 Alloy, 0.031" Diameter](https://amzn.to/2zcpvcl)
- [Kester 24-6337-0010 44 Rosin Core Solder 63/37 .020" Diameter](https://amzn.to/2KSbB3M)
- [Kester 83-4000-0000 SN60PB40 Solder Pocket Pack, 0.031" Wire Diameter](https://amzn.to/2u659LS) - Good for if you don't need so much solder

### Flush Cutters

You'll need flush cutters for clipping diode legs, resistor legs, and Pro Micro header pins.

- [Hakko CHP-170 Micro Cutter](https://amzn.to/2MOv8iE)
- [Plato 170 Flush Cutter](https://amzn.to/2KU815S) - A bit cheaper and bakingpy's cutter of choice, since the cuts are a bit more flush than the Hakko ones

## Extras

Here's some additional items you might find to be handy during builds:

- Soldering Iron Tip Cleaner
- Solder Sucker and Wick
- Hookup Wire
- Helping hands/PCB holder
- Multimeter
- Solder Spool Holder
- Flux

### Tip Cleaner/Tinner

Using a wet sponge to clean your tip is okay, but using a brass wire ball cleans better and doesn't reduce the temperature of the soldering iron tip. Highly recommended.

- [Hakko 599B-02 Wire-type soldering iron tip cleaner](https://amzn.to/2MT57id)
- [Aoyue Soldering Iron Tip Cleaner](https://amzn.to/2IY77Uj) - A bit easier to swipe the iron tip across than the Hakko one, also has an iron holder arm on it

Tip Tinner: Good to use once at the beginning of a soldering session instead of tinning with solder and helps restore tips

- [Thermaltronics FBA_TMT-TC-2 Lead Free Tip Tinner](https://amzn.to/2J45STC)

### Solder Sucker and Wick

You're bound to screw up a build at some point, and you're going to need some way to remove that solder. Highly recommended to buy a solder sucker of some sort, wick is not that important to have.

- [Blue and Metal Solder Sucker ($)](https://amzn.to/2MVlxXD) - There's a bunch of these cheap suckers sold under various listings and despite the price, they get the job done.
    - Pro tip: [Cut the tip at an angle to make it a bit easier to use, as shown in this picture](assets/images/misc/desoldering-pump-cut.jpg)
- [Engineer SS-02 Solder Sucker ($$)](https://amzn.to/2m3s7jv) - A favorite among many people
- [Hakko Sppon No. 20 ($$)](http://www.hakko.com/english/products/hakko_sppon_tips.html)

- Desoldering Irons
    - [Velleman VTDESOL3U Vacuum Desoldering Pump With Heater 30W ($)](https://amzn.to/2IZZGMp) - Careful with this one as you depress the pump, as hot solder will come flying out of it. But you can desolder a whole board quickly with this
    - [Hakko FR300-05/P Desoldering Tool ($$$)](https://amzn.to/2MPWANd) - If you're going to be desoldering whole boards
- Wick
    - [Chemtronics 80-3-5 Desoldering Braid](https://amzn.to/2NvLheb)
    - [MG Chemicals #3 No Clean Super Wick Desoldering Braid](https://amzn.to/2tXrHzw)

### Hookup Wire

Needed for attaching an RGB LED strip, using as jumper wires, or handwiring. Recommended wire gauge is 22 AWG to 28 AWG, make sure it's solid core and not stranded. Having multiple colors is also recommended.

- 24 AWG
    - [Remington Industries 24UL1007SLDKIT UL1007 24 AWG Gauge Solid Hook-Up Wire Kit](https://amzn.to/2KSCaSW)
    - [Striveday™ 24 AWG Hook Up Wire 1007 PVC Solid wire Kit](https://amzn.to/2zfTP5X)
- 22 AWG
    - [Electronix Express Hook up Wire Kit (Solid Wire Kit) 22 Gauge](https://amzn.to/2KRj9QN)
    - [Remington Industries 22UL1007SLDKIT UL1007 22 AWG Gauge Solid Hook-Up Wire Kit](https://amzn.to/2tXw3Xa)

### Helping hands/PCB holder

- [Aven 17010 Adjustable Circuit Board Holder](https://amzn.to/2KDd6mT)
- [Pro'sKit 900-015 Helping Hands Soldering Aid](https://amzn.to/2lWEnlu)
- [QuadHands Helping Hands](https://amzn.to/2NtNUNL)

### Multimeter

No specific recommendations, main thing you'll probably use it for is checking for continuity, so having one that beeps is nice (most multimeters have beep option). The free/cheap ones from Harbor Freight will do the job.

- [Innova 3320 Auto-Ranging Digital Multimeter](https://amzn.to/2KzsKzT)

### Solder Spool Holder

Better than just leaving the solder spool sitting on its side.

- [Delcast SL-RL Solder Dispenser Reel](https://amzn.to/2u8bSoN)

### Flux

Helps solder stick better. Usually the flux in solder will do just fine, but this can help sometimes.

- [SRA Rosin Flux Pen](https://amzn.to/2KUUpYf)
- [https://amzn.to/2KUUpYf](https://amzn.to/2MRMc7K)
