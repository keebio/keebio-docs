# Recommended Soldering Tools

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.keeb.io/assets/images/tools.jpg)

So you want to build a keyboard, but are unsure of exactly what you'll need? Don't worry, here's a list of suggested tools for soldering. Some of these items with have a star (★) next to them, as these are the ones that Keebio has.

## The Essentials

At the minimum, you'll need these items to build the keyboards that Keebio offers:

- Soldering Iron
- Solder
- Flush Cutters

### Soldering Iron

A temperature-controlled soldering iron is recommended. Even though you can get by with using a non-temperature-controlled one, for a beginner, it's very easy to burn pads on a PCB due to inconsistent temperatures and the iron getting too hot. A decent temperature-controlled soldering iron is not much more expensive than a regular one.

Here's a list of some suggested ones:

- ★ [KSGER T12 Soldering Iron Station ($$)](https://www.amazon.com/KSGER-Temperature-Controller-Electronic-Equipments/dp/B07PYFSCJ9/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=keebio-20&linkId=822712355244e8e266aa9f3a0e9cc199&language=en_US) - Recommended mid-tier option. Tips heat up to the right temperature fairly quickly and are hotswappable without needing to turn off the station. Handles soldering to ground planes well due to good thermal mass. Pro tip: Only thing to note is that when changing the tip, to get the station to recognize it properly, press in the control knob and turn it to select the correct tip.

Tips heat up in 2-3 seconds, and they are hotswappable. Handles soldering to ground planes very easily. Highly recommended.

#### Integrated soldering iron and hot air stations

If you plan on doing some work with SMD components in the future, having a hot air station is great to have and sometimes doesn't cost that much more than a regular iron.

- ★ [2in1 862D+ SMD Soldering Iron Hot Air Rework Station LED Display ($$)](https://www.amazon.com/VIVOHOME-Soldering-Rework-Station-Nozzles/dp/B07JJWRRN1/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=862d+&qid=1587486703&s=hi&sr=1-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=keebio-20&linkId=9954bb92bc149f84ef70f618bb39a621&language=en_US)

### Solder

Avoid lead-free solder unless you are more experienced. Lead-free solder requires high temperatures, and for someone starting out with soldering, using it often leads to cold joints and/or overheating of pads. Leaded solder is fine, and that's what most people use anyway. Don't cheap out on solder!

Diameter: 0.031" solder is good for general usage. For SMD components which are smaller, 0.020" is recommended.

Tin/Lead Ratio: 63/37 or 60/40 are good ratios to go with. 63/37 stands for 63% tin, 37% lead.

Tip Tinner: Good to use once at the beginning of a soldering session instead of tinning with solder and helps restore tips

- ★ [Thermaltronics FBA_TMT-TC-2 Lead Free Tip Tinner](https://www.amazon.com/Thermaltronics-FBA_TMT-TC-2-Lead-Tinner-Container/dp/B00NS4J6BY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=industrial&linkCode=ll1&tag=keebio-20&linkId=86661a5d933e89db8ff7850501d23c37&language=en_US)

### Solder Sucker and Wick

You're bound to screw up a build at some point, and you're going to need some way to remove that solder. Highly recommended to buy a solder sucker of some sort, wick is not that important to have.

- ★ [Blue and Metal Solder Sucker ($)](https://www.amazon.com/Desoldering-Solder-Sucker-Length-Remover/dp/B07BB8DGMP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=keebio-20&linkId=6d99e11bc738533735139d3d3b390f8a&language=en_US) - There's a bunch of these cheap suckers sold under various listings and despite the price, they get the job done.
