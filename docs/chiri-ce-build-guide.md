## Build Similarity

Since the Chiri CE has been designed in a similar manner to the Iris CE, refer to the [Iris CE Build Guide](iris-ce-build-guide) for build instructions.

Differences to note:
* The Chiri CE plate support material is made of EVA foam instead of poron
* If using the 3x5 layout, you will need to break off the outer column of the PCBs
